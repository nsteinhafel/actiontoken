actiontoken
===========
*This project is a work in progress.*


The purpose of this application is to allow someone (presumably the user) to perform an action on behalf of a user without forcing a login. A simple example case is to let a user change their email settings (ie. unsubscribe) without explcitly logging in. I am already using similar code in an existing Django site and this is basically the refactor into a more generic solution.
