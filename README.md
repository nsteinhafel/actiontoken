actiontoken
===========
*This project is a work in progress.*


The purpose of this application is to allow someone (presumably the user) to perform an action on behalf of a user without forcing a login. A simple example case is to let a user change their email settings (ie. unsubscribe) without explcitly logging in, but without giving them the keys to the kingdom ("hey, should I really let this unauthorized user delete this object?").

I am already using similar code in an existing Django site and this is basically the refactor into a more generic solution.
