todo:
- validate models on save according to rules -> test in unit test
- allow Rule groups rather than a 1-to-1 Token-to-Rule relationship
- refactor Actions out of Rules to allow them to be easily applied at Field level
- check fields (if any) and permissions (on model save?)
  . C -> None to Something
  . R -> (can we really validate this w/out implementer's action?)
  . U -> Something -> Something different
  . D -> Something -> None
- add optional primary key for entity on Rule that is checked on read/update/delete (should throw error on create) to only give access to one object
  . None here gives full control over model?
- actiontoken-sample Django project
- allow actions to be taken w/out a user
